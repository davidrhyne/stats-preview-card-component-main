## My process

I started by visualizing the segments the pages to determine how the markup should be coded.  From there, I wrote the markup and started the CSS with the mobile-first workflow. I finished by adding the media query to add the CSS for the desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to get started and complete a small project without having 80-90% of the outline completed.  Previously, all the projects that I have done have been from a Scrimba or Udemy course.  And while believe I have learned many skills from those courses, this was the first project that started with the design and the rest was up to me to complete.  

### Continued development

I am really looking forward to the feedback. I would like to know what I should fix and/or focus on with the next project.  I am most concerned with the responsiveness from the desktop to the mobile resolutions.  I am thinking I needed to use background-image with background-blend-mode instead of a image element, but thought the transition in the 600px screen width was rough.  

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Resizing_background_images) - The MDN resources on background images really helped with this project.  
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - Another MDN resource, but this one is on the CSS variables used for the colors.
